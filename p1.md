### Dangling Else

> * An else is always associated with the closest unmatched if inside the same pair of braces.

```c
    // The program fragment on the left is equivalent to the one on the right 
    ...                 ...
    if (a)              if (a)
        if (b);         {
    else;                   if (b);
    ...                     else;
                        }
                        ... 
```

### Asymmetric Bounds

> * Express a range by the first element of the range and the first element beyond it.

```c
    ...
    char arr[N];
    char *p = arr;          // p represent the first free character in the arr[]
    *p++ = 'c';             // p again points at the first free character
    int len = p - arr;      // asymmetric bounds
    int avl = N - len;      // the number of characters available in a[]

    if (p == &arr[N])       
    /* sticking to principles about asymmetric bounds. use 
     * if (p == &arr[N)) 
     * instead of the effectively equivalent 
     * if (p > &arr[N-1))
     */
        printf("full");
    ...
```
