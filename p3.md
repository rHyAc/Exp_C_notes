```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    FILE *fopen(const char *pathname, const char *mode);
    /* The fopen() function opens the file whose name is the string pointed to 
       by pathname and associates a stream with it. The argument mode points to 
       a string beginning with one of the following sequences (possibly 
       followed by additional characters, as described below):
        * r     Open text file for reading. The stream is positioned at the 
                beginning of the file.
        * r+    Open for reading and writing. The stream is positioned at the 
                beginning of the file.
        * w     Truncate file to zero length or create text file for writing. 
                The stream is positioned at the beginning of the file.
        * w+    Open for reading and writing. The file is created if it does 
                not exist, otherwise it is truncated. The stream is positioned 
                at the beginning of the file.
        * a     Open for appending (writing at end of file). The file is 
                created if it does not exist. The stream is positioned at the 
                end of the file.
        * a+    Open for reading and appending (writing at end of file). The 
                file is created if it does not exist. The initial file 
                position for reading is at the beginning of the file, but 
                output is always appended to the end of the file.
     
     * Therefore it is good practice (and indeed sometimes necessary under 
       Linux) to put an fseek() or fgetpos() operation between write and read 
       operations on such a stream. This operation may be an apparent no-op (as 
       in fseek(..., 0L, SEEK_CUR) called for its synchronizing side effect).

     * RETURN VALUE
            Upon successful completion fopen(), fdopen() and freopen() return a 
            FILE pointer. Otherwise, NULL is returned and errno is set to 
            indicate the error.
     */

    size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream);
    size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream);
    /* The function fread() reads nmemb items of data, each size bytes long, 
       from the stream pointed to by stream, storing them at the location given 
       by ptr.

     * The function fwrite() writes nmemb items of data, each size bytes long, 
       to the stream pointed to by stream, obtaining them from the location 
       given by ptr.
    
     * RETURN VALUE
            On success, fread() and fwrite() return the number of items read 
            or written. This number equals the number of bytes transferred 
            only when size is 1. If an error occurs, or the end of the file is 
            reached, the return value is a short item count (or zero).

            fread() does not distinguish between end-of-file and error, and 
            callers must use feof() and ferror() to determine which occurred.
     */

    int fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int whence);
    /* The fseek() function sets the file position indicator for the stream 
       pointed to by stream. The new position, measured in bytes, is obtained 
       by adding offset bytes to the position specified by whence. If whence is 
       set to SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END, the offset is relative to the 
       start of the file, the current position indicator, or end-of-file, 
       respectively. A successful call to the fseek() function clears the 
       end-of-file indicator for the stream and undoes any effects of the 
       ungetc() function on the same stream.
    
     * RETURN VALUE
            Upon successful completion, fseek()returns the current offset. 
            Otherwise, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.
     */

    void clearerr(FILE *stream);
    int feof(FILE *stream);
    int ferror(FILE *stream);
    /* The function clearerr() clears the end-of-file and error indicators for 
       the stream pointed to by stream.
     
     * The function feof() tests the end-of-file indicator for the stream 
       pointed to by stream, returning nonzero if it is set. The end-of-file 
       indicator can be cleared only by the function clearerr().

     * The function ferror() tests the error indicator for the stream pointed 
       to by stream, returning nonzero if it is set. The error indicator can be 
       reset only by the clearerr() function.

    void setbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf);
    /* Except for unbuffered files, the buf argument should point to a buffer; 
       this buffer will be used instead of the current buffer. If the argument 
       buf is NULL, only the mode is affected; a new buffer will be allocated 
       on the next read or write operation. 

     *BUGS
            You must make sure that the space that buf points to still exists 
            by the time stream is closed, which also happens at program 
            termination. For example, the following is invalid:

            #include <stdio.h>

            int main(void)
            {
                char buf[BUFSIZ];
                setbuf(stdin, buf);
                printf("Hello, world!\n");
                return 0;
            }
     */
```

```c
    #include <stdlib.h>

    int rand(void);
    void srand(unsigned int seed);
    /* The rand() function returns a pseudo-random integer in the range 0 to 
       RAND_MAX inclusive (i.e., the mathematical range [0, RAND_MAX]).

     * The srand() function sets its argument as the seed for a new sequence 
       of pseudo-random integers to be returned by rand(). These sequences are 
       repeatable by calling srand() with the same seed value.

     * If no seed value is provided, the rand() function is automatically 
       seeded with a value of 1.
    
     * RETURN VALUE
            The rand() functions return a value between 0 and RAND_MAX (inclusive).
    
     * EXAMPLE
    
            #include <stdlib.h>
            #incldue <time.h>

            int main(void)
            {
                srand((unsigned)time(0));
                int r = rand();
                return 0;
            } 
     */

    int abs(int j);
    /* The abs() function computes the absolute value of the integer argument j.

     * RETURN VALUE
            Returns the absolute value of the integer argument, of the 
            appropriate integer type for the function.
    
     * NOTES
            Trying to take the absolute value of the most negative integer is 
            not defined.

       to by s with the constant byte c.
    
     * RETURN VALUE
            The memset() function returns a pointer to the memory area s.
     */

    void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n);
    /* The memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area 
       dest. The memory areas must not overlap. Use memmove(3) if the memory 
       areas do overlap.

            The memcpy() function returns a pointer to dest.
